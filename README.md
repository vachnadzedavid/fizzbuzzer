Basically a code that i wrote in 10 min in vscode for my computer science A-Level course
it is a fizz buzz programming game that you have to write a code that prints from 1 to 100, for multiples of 3 it prints fuzz, for multiples of 5 it prints buzz and for multiples of both 3 and 5 it prints "FizzBuzz!!"

These are the concepts we have to cover:

Count how many time Fizz is printed
Count how many times Buzz is printed
Count how many times FizzBuzz is printed

We also have to display a summary at the end of the code on how many times each term was printed, also we have to count the numbers that aren't fizzbuzz numbers:

Iterating through numbers from 1 to 100.
Checking multiple conditions for each number.
Determining if a number is divisible by 3 or 5.  ( the % operator )

These are the steps to build out program:

Use a loop to iterate from 1 to 100.
For each number:
If it’s divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
If it’s divisible by 3, print "Fizz."
If it’s divisible by 5, print "Buzz."
Otherwise, print the number.
Print the appropriate result for each number based on the conditions.
Write Pseudocode, flowchart and program code for the above requirement.
